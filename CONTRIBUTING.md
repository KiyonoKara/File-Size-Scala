## Getting Started

## Pull Requests
- To create a Pull Request, you must fork this repository and make your changes, and they must be ready for merging into the main/staging branch.
- For additions, removals, new features, new files, new directories, please create a Pull Request.
    1. It is highly recommended that Pull Requests are made to be reviewable which means that whatever is being proposed/awaiting approval can be read by others and makes sense. 
    2. It is preferred that Pull Requests have fairly small to medium-sized changes so reviewing is much easier.
- In your Pull Request, be sure that you explain what is being changed and why it is important for the repository.
- If your Pull Request seeks to fix typos, please point out some general typos in this code or markdown files, so everyone knows that these typo fixes are actually fixing the typos.   

## Issues
- For bugs, fixes, proposal of new features, feedback, or support, please create an Issue.
    1. Please remember to describe what your inquiry is, and make sure it is related to the repository.
    2. Labeling your Issue is recommended.
- You can add reactions instead of replying to follow-ups that don't require replies.
